Hello Professor and/or person that is grading my project. I apologize for the inconvenience, but I misunderstood the requirements for this project early on. When it was mentioned that we could place our articles "on the previous website for project 1" I had assumed that meant we were supposed to be doing the html coding/article write-ups in WebStorm. I did not realize at first that we could create html files within Pycharm and those would work all the same. I have copied the html files, css style sheet, and images that I used for Project 2 within WebStorm, into this repository. I know this is not ideal, as I only have one commit here with all the html work being dumped in. However, below is a link to the Github Repository that contains all the incremental commits I made while working on this project. The branch is "Project 2."

Once again, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, and I appreciate your understanding.
